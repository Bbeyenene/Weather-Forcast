# Weather-Forcast

This Weather Dashboord application is developed based on [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). This app is developed to show my personal skill on the ablity to fetch data from third-party APIs and retrive neccessary parameters for the weather forcast of a particular city. `waz-app.html`, A`ssets/css/waz-app.css`, `Assets/js/waz-app` files and `Assets/images` are linked to this app.

# Instructions
