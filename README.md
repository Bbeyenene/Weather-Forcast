# Weather-Forcast

This Weather Dashboord application is developed based on [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to show my personal skill on the ablity to fetch data from third-party APIs and retrive neccessary parameters for the weather forcast of a particular city. A `waz-app.html` file and directories `Assets/css/waz-app.css`, `Assets/js/waz-app` and `Assets/images` are linked to this app.

# Instructions

1. Input name of the city in the search city box, then click search to get the current weather and five days weather forcast.

3. Else if a city is entered correctly, the current weather and weather forcast is desplayed and the city is added to the searched history local storage data. 

4. Furthermore, the weeather of a particular city can be searched from the search box or from the city list.

5. Cities history local storage can be cleared by clicking in the clear histry button after a confirmition for an alert to avoid accidental clear.
